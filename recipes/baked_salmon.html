            <img src="images/Salmon.jpg">
            <p>Whether you’re cooking salmon for just the family or a host of friends, plopping a big, beautiful, coral-hued baked salmon fillet in the middle 
               of the table is a nicely modern twist on the classic Rockwellian move of gathering the crew around a roast bird. </p>
            <p>My easy baked salmon recipe makes for a feast-like meal that you can dress up with snazzy side dishes to serve to company, or enjoy as a healthy, 
               simple and quick dinner on a busy weeknight! Healthy, delicious, versatile—and we promise you can master this salmon recipe in one go.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A whole salmon fillet</li>
                <li>Brown sugar</li>
                <li>Paprika (not the smoked kind—just regular paprika).</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make an easy salmon spice rub by mixing together the brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with foil for a much easier clean up. Yes, you can bake it directly on the pan, but just trust us, 
                    you don’t want to scrape salmon skin off an unlined baking sheet. It is the kitchen task of doom. Put the salmon fillet on the baking sheet, 
                    pink side up, skin side down.</li>
                <li>Brush the salmon with olive oil and spice mixture.</li>
                <li>Bake the salmon fillet! 375°F for 10-15 minutes, watching closely so as not to overcook salmon.</li>
            </ol>
