                        <h3>Directions</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. 
                                    Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.</li>
                                <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. 
                                    Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 
                                    Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through.</li>
                                <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
                                <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, 
                                    a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, 
                                    Parmesan, and mozzarella.</li>
                                <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
